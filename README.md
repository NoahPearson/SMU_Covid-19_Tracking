# SMU Covid-19 Tracking
In the interest of visualization and analysis, I'm presenting the data reported by SMU: https://blog.smu.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/cases/

__Last Updated: 9/1/2020__

The data presented are the reported cases on the day they're reported to SMU. We don't know when the test was taken by the student or when they reported to SMU. So, the significant uptick after classes began _actually_ was happening probably a few days earlier. SMU also tends to under-report the most recent day (meaning they report cases they received that day later). For that reason, I didn't compute the moving average for the last day.

Total cumulative cases:
