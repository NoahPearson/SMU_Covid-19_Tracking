# SMU Covid-19 Tracking
In the interest of visualization and analysis, I'm presenting the data reported by SMU: https://blog.smu.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/cases/

I start recording on move-in day, Aug. 17. Classes began a week later on Aug. 24.

__Last Updated: 9/1/2020__

The data presented are the reported cases on the day they're reported to SMU. We don't know when the test was taken by the student or when they reported to SMU. So, the significant uptick after classes began _actually_ was happening a few days earlier. SMU also tends to under-report the most recent day (meaning they report some of the cases they received that day, later). For that reason, I didn't compute the moving averages for the last day.

Hopefully SMU will also make positivity/number of tests, isolation capacity, among other data publicly accessible.

To add:
* growth factor
* models/projections
* "Go home" time scale estimate
* "turn-over point" analysis (when spread begins to decrease and level out)
